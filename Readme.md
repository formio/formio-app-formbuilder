A form building application.
---------------------------------

Overview
--------

This Application is designed to demonstrate and provide a framework for a web app that does two things. First, it allows administrators to log in and create, update, and delete forms within the application. Second, it allows users to log in, view the list of forms, and fill out the forms. Administrators can also view all submissions from the users. 


Installation
--------------
You can easily get this application running by typing the following in your command line.

```
npm install -g formio-cli
formio bootstrap formio/formio-app-formbuilder
```

Next you will need to create an Admin account by logging into your Form.io account and then creating a new
Admin login under the *Admin* Resource.
